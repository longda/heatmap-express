# Heatmap Express
A coding sample... In order to gain visibility into how our players are experiencing our game, we want to collect data about each player death. This event would include such values as their location and how they died.
 
The ultimate goal of this system would be to generate a heat map overlaid on top of a game map to indicate common death locations.
 
1. Design a system such that:

  (A) Data collection can occur frequently (1+ deaths per minute, per player).  Assume that events will be generated by hundreds to thousands of game servers, across multiple data centers.
 
  (B) Data storage allows for flexible heat map generation, such as filters based on event data, real-time maps, etc.
 
2. Build a prototype in the language of your choice that exemplifies the core of your design and that can generate an accurate heat map from sample data â€“ which you can provide.
 
Please document how much time you spend completing this task, as well as any notes you feel are relevant. Also be prepared to defend your choices in terms of scalability, extensibility, and maintainability.

## Installation and Setup
1. Install [Node with NPM](http://nodejs.org/)
2. Download code from github
3. cd into the heatmap-express directory: ``` $ cd heatmap-express ```
4. Install all the packages: ``` $ npm install ```
5. *(Optional)* Change the mongo db connection string in /routes/api.js to point to your instance of mongo db
6. Run the app using node: ``` $ node app.js ``` or heroku: ``` $ foreman start ```

## Design Explanation
This sample pertains primarily to the storage system for events generated from some game, storage and retrieval via calls
into a REST API, and one sample display in a web application. At this time, no considerations have been made as to
security regarding the calls into the API.

### Data Model
The data model used for this app is a simple and flexible using the equivalent of foreign key ids from a relational model
for common objects such as users (killer/killed), maps, weapons, etc.  These could be references into a relational system
or embedded documents of a NO SQL system such as Mongo.  Since these would be extremely redundant if embedded into 
thousands of records, I've chosen to just use foreign keys for now.  It is assumed that a reference of map id 1 would be
resolved trivially via a master map list or a GetMapById() call.
