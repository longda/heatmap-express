# Heatmap Express

A coding sample... In order to gain visibility into how our players are experiencing our game, we want to collect data about each player death. This event would include such values as their location and how they died.
 
The ultimate goal of this system would be to generate a heat map overlaid on top of a game map to indicate common death locations.
 
1. Design a system such that:

  (A) Data collection can occur frequently (1+ deaths per minute, per player).  Assume that events will be generated by hundreds to thousands of game servers, across multiple data centers.
 
  (B) Data storage allows for flexible heat map generation, such as filters based on event data, real-time maps, etc.
 
2. Build a prototype in the language of your choice that exemplifies the core of your design and that can generate an accurate heat map from sample data â€“ which you can provide.
 
Please document how much time you spend completing this task, as well as any notes you feel are relevant. Also be prepared to defend your choices in terms of scalability, extensibility, and maintainability.
